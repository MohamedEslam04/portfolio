  Hi, I'm **Mohamed Eslam**, a Frontend Developer based in Cairo, Egypt. I specialize in building dynamic, responsive user interfaces and developing reusable npm packages to enhance code modularity and scalability in frontend projects.

  My journey began at **Cairo University**, where I earned a B.S. in Computers and Artificial Intelligence. There, I developed a strong foundation in computer science and artificial intelligence principles, which I now apply to real-world web development challenges.

  ### My Approach

  My philosophy centers on **problem-solving**, **collaboration**, and **continuous learning**. I believe that great digital products are created by combining technical excellence with a deep understanding of user needs. I focus on:
  - Building accessible, performant, and maintainable UI components (Vue 3, Nuxt 3, Tailwind CSS)
  - Ensuring optimized performance and seamless user experience
  - Collaborating closely with designers and backend teams to deliver user-friendly features

  ### Skills & Tools

  - **Frontend:** Nuxt 3, Vue 3, React, Tailwind CSS, SCSS, HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript
  - **UI Libraries:** Nuxt UI, HeadlessUI, Bootstrap
  - **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub, CI/CD
  - **Other:** RESTful APIs, Responsive Design, NPM Package Development

  ### What Drives Me

  I am passionate about translating complex ideas into simple, elegant solutions. I enjoy the challenge of building scalable systems and seeing my work make a tangible impact for users and teams. I am always eager to learn new technologies and contribute to open source.

  ### Beyond Code

  Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring technology trends, UI/UX design, and contributing to open-source projects. I value teamwork, adaptability, and continuous improvement.
